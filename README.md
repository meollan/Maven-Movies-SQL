Welcome! I'm Meollan Tagle, an Industrial Engineer transitioning into Data Analytics. 
I’m eager to leverage my skills in project management and Lean Six Sigma to drive impactful results.

Join me on my journey into Data Analytics and Business Intelligence!
This is just only the first part that tackles the big 6 query and the case statement

The training I have is in UDEMY lead by Maven with a title
SQL for Data Analysis: Beginner MySQL Business Intelligence

In this case our database includes
16 related tables , containing information

Customers Name, Address, etc.
Business Staff, Rentals, etc.
Inventory Films, Categories, etc.

In this Database we are going to analyze the relationship between the Data
The simulation gives me a job to become a Business Intelligence Analyst

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, the management ask me to do the following tasks:
1.	“I’m going to send an email letting our customers know there has been a management change. Could you pull a list of the first name, last name, and email of each of our customers?”
2.	“My understanding is that we have titles that we rent for durations of 3, 5, or 7days. Could you pull the records of our films and see if there are any other rental durations?”
3.	“I’d like to look at payment records for our long-term customers to learn about their purchase patterns. Could you pull all payments from our first 100 customers (based on customer ID)?”
4.	“The payment data you gave me on our first 100 customers was great –thank you! Now I’d love to see just payments over $5for those same customers, since January 1, 2006.”  
5.	“The data you shared previously on customers 42, 53, 60, and 75 was good to see. Now, could you please write a query to pull all payments from those specific customers, along with payments over $5, from any customer?”
6.	“We need to understand the special featuresin our films. Could you pull a list of films which include a Behind the Scenes special feature?”
7.	“I need to get a quick overview of how long our movies tend to be rented out for. Could you please pull a count of titles sliced by rental duration?”
8.	“I’m wondering if we charge more for a rental when the replacement cost is higher. Can you help me pull a count of films, along with the average, min, and max rental rate, grouped by replacement cost?”
9.	“I’d like to talk to customers that have not rented much from us to understand if there is something we could be doing better. Could you pull a list of customer_ids with less than 15 rentals all-time?”
10.	“I’d like to see if our longest films also tend to be our most expensive rentals. Could you pull me a list of all film titles along with their lengths and rental rates, and sort them from longest to shortest?”
11.	“I’d like to know which store each customer goes to, and whether they are active or not. Could you pull a list of first and last names of all customers, and label them as either ‘store 1 active’, ‘store 1 inactive’, ‘store 2 active’, or ‘store 2 inactive’?”
12.	“I’m curious how many inactive customers we have at each store. Could you please create a table to count the number of customers broken down by store_id(in rows), and active status (in columns)?”

Task #1.	“I’m going to send an email letting our customers know there has been a management change. 
Could you pull a list of the first name, last name, and email of each of our customers?”
